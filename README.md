# repl-ns

Namespace for REPL driven development for TypeScript/JavaScript. 
Inspired by Clojure namespaces.
Currently tested on Node.js, but potentially can be used on any JavaScript runtime (Deno, Bun, Browser and so on...)

### Code examples

See [tests](https://github.com/darky/repl-ns/blob/master/test.ts)

### Node.js receipt

Feel free to use **repl-ns** in tandem with [node-remote-repl](https://github.com/darky/node-remote-repl) for effective REPL driven development
